## Korean Word Explanation Template (for Learners)

### 1. Title

```md
# [Korean Word] ([Hanja, if any])
```

* If there is no common hanja, you can either:

  * leave the hanja out: `# [Korean Word]`
  * or write something like: `([No common hanja / native Korean word])`.

### 2. Breakdown

```md
## Breakdown
* **[Syllable / Hanja 1]**: [Core meaning / gloss]
* **[Syllable / Hanja 2]**: [Core meaning / gloss]
* **Literal Meaning:** "[Very short literal translation or image]"
```

**How to use this section well:**

* For Sino-Korean words:

  * Give the **hanja character** and a **1–3 word gloss**.
  * Optionally mention a tiny bit of background if it adds a clear image (e.g., 女 + 昏 for 婚).
* For native Korean words:

  * Break into **meaningful parts** if possible, or explain it as a single block.
* Literal meaning:

  * Keep it **short and vivid** (e.g., “to tie a marriage,” “heart + feeling,” “inside the house”).
  * Aim for something that helps the learner “see” the word.

### 4. Background & Nuance

```md
## Background & Nuance
[Explain the hanja composition or origin briefly, and any cultural or emotional nuance.]

- [Hanja / origin explanation]
- [Cultural or historical image, if relevant]
- [Nuance: is it emotional, technical, polite, harsh, poetic, etc.?]
```

**How to use this section well:**

* Hanja:

  * Mention meaningful components (e.g., “女 (woman) + 昏 (dusk) → old custom of evening weddings”).
* Culture:

  * Only add if it genuinely helps understanding a typical usage or feeling.
* Nuance:

  * Is it more **legal**, **everyday**, **romantic**, **cold**, **cute**, etc.?

Keep this **short and focused**, like 2–5 sentences.
